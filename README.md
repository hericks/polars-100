# 100 Polars Exercises

This is a collection of polars exercises that have been collected on stack overflow and the polars documentation. The project is heavily inspired by [numpy-100](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100), which is a similar collection of numpy exercises. The goal of this collection is to offer a quick reference for both old and new users but also to provide a set of exercises for those who teach.

**Note.** Jupyter notebooks are created programmatically from the source data in `src/data/exercises.ktx`. To modify the content of these files, please change the text in the source and run the `src/generator.py` with a python interpreter from the root directoy of this project with the libraries under `requirements.txt` installed.

The keyed text format (`ktx`) is a minimal human readable key-values to store text (markdown or others) indexed by keys. 

**Disclaimer.** This project is still in its early stages, and the exercises are not yet complete. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request.

**Current progress.** *(not automatically updated)* 21 / 100 exercises
